## To change them to English (or raw-like format), we can update this file.

#  For example:
#
#   1 actions:
#   2   move:
#   3     params: ["actor", "from", "to"]
#   4     description: "move {actor} {from} {to}"

#  Or just simple English:
#
#   1 actions:
#   2   move:
#   3     params: ["actor", "from", "to"]
#   4     description: "Move from {from} to {to}"
