  ACTION: The Player DEPLOYS A LOGICAL PARADOX ('{target}').
  
  CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. This is a CATASTROPHIC SYSTEM FAILURE. 
  2. The character must SCREAM in text (use ALL CAPS for parts of the dialogue).
  3. Use heavy text corruption and glitches: E-E-RROR, SYST_EM HALT, NULL_VOID, 010101.
  4. Describe the environment literally exploding, flickering, or fracturing into red strobe lights and sirens.
  5. The NPC's analytical diction is COMPLETELY BROKEN. No more calm or beautiful sentences! It must be chaotic and terrifying.
